## Features

- Search the web using a static proxy.
- Access to most websites
- Deployable on any static hosting platform
<br><br>

## Why do you redirect to /active?
So whenever you deploy this site, you don't HAVE to deploy it at root. Just drag and drop the ```active``` folder into the root of your main website, and your good to go!

## Deployment

To deploy this website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: ```https://github.com/tf7software/UV-Static.git```
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd UV-Static`
4. Run `index.html` using ```python3 -m http.server 3000``` or your server of choice.
5. Navigate to [localhost with port 3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Disclamer
We take no credit for the making of UV. Ultraviolet is made by Titanium Network, and therefore isn't ours. This is just a modification built to it to make it static, allowing you to deploy it on simple hosting platofrms like vercel, netlify, onrender static, and etc. You are welcome to edit files to your need, just credit TIW-UV-Static ;)
